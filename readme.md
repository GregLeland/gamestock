<center> <h1>Video Game Company Stock and Sentiment Analysis</h1> </center>

This project is based around getting real-time stock information and running a sentiment analysis on a recent major news article to see if there are any correlations between media coverage and current stock prices. It is currently a work in progress.

This project currently utilizes Python 3.x, NLTK's Vader Sentiment Intensity Analyzer, Flask, HTML, and CSS.

Future plans include:

<ul>
<li>Incorporate social media sentiment from Twitter and Reddit</li>
<li>Articles from a wider variety of online news outlets</li>
<li>User-input-based stocks with a fuzzy auto-complete search in additon to the 8 major stocks that the project was created around</li>
<li>Graphs and charts comparing stock trends and sentiment trends</li>
</ul>
